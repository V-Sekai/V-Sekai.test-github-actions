# Summary of V-Sekai.test-github-actions

Hello,

I'm writing to give you a brief overview of the `V-Sekai.test-github-actions` repository.

## What's in the Repository?

The `V-Sekai.test-github-actions` repository is where we test and implement GitHub Actions. These actions automate our software workflows right in our repository, handling everything from creating game executables to releasing the game.

## Main Features

1. **Creating and Uploading Artifacts:** The action creates placeholders for game executable files and uploads them as artifacts. This happens whenever there's a push or a pull request.

```yaml
name: ðŸ”— GHA
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  create-and-upload-artifact:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create placeholders
        run: |
          echo "Creating placeholders..."
          echo "This is a placeholder for game.exe" > game.exe
          echo "This is a placeholder for game_editor.exe" > game_editor.exe
          echo "This is a placeholder for game.pck" > game.pck
      - name: Upload game executable
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: game-executable
          path: game.exe
      - name: Upload game editor
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: game-editor
          path: game_editor.exe
      - name: Upload game pck
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: game-pck
          path: game.pck
```

2. **Releasing the Game:** The action downloads the previously uploaded artifacts and releases the game. This only happens when a new tag is created.

```yaml
release:
  needs: create-and-upload-artifact
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  steps:
    - name: Download game executable
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: game-executable
        path: ./artifacts/game-executable
    - name: Download game editor
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: game-editor
        path: ./artifacts/game-editor
    - name: Download game pck
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: game-pck
        path: ./artifacts/game-pck
    - name: Release
      uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
      with:
        files: |
          ./artifacts/game-executable/game.exe
          ./artifacts/game-editor/game_editor.exe
          ./artifacts/game-pck/game.pck
        body: "This is a V-Sekai/V-Sekai.test-github-actions release"
        generate_release_notes: true
        append_body: true
```

## Wrapping Up

In short, the `V-Sekai.test-github-actions` repository uses GitHub Actions to automate our software development workflows. This includes creating and uploading artifacts, and releasing the game.

I hope this gives you a good understanding of the repository. If you have any questions or need more information, don't hesitate to ask.
